              <div class="About-us-content">
              Cisco is the worldwide leader in technology that powers the Internet. Our products and services include networking, collaboration
              solutions, security solutions, wireless and mobility, data center, IoT, video, analytics,and software solutions. Cisco’s purpose is to Power an Inclusive
              Future for All. Our Purpose Report and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) focus areas are organized according to the three key pillars of our purpose:
              Power,Inclusive, and Future. But perhaps the most important words of Cisco’s purpose statement are the final two: “for All.”Partnership and collaboration with our
              customers and stakeholders, throughout our value chain, and across the industry, allow us to multiply our efforts and scale our impact.
              We know we have a responsibility to lead by example, and Cisco has a rich history of supporting communities, doing what’s right, and caring about the world around us. It’s
             ingrained in our culture and central to how we run our business every day. I am confident we will continue to bring together the power of our people, our technologies, and our
             innovation to show up in times of need, address inequalities,protect our planet, and create more inclusive opportunities for people to thrive. 
             Governmental organizations at all levels around the world use Cisco technology. They also set policies and regulations that determine how technology should operate. Engaging with
             policymakers, regulators, and government agencies on matters related to security, privacy, and trust is an essential part of our work. For example, we occasionally receive requests for
             data related to ongoing investigations from law enforcement,intelligence agencies, or governments. When this happens, Cisco follows a strict set of policies and procedures to help ensure
             that data disclosures are minimized and controlled, and that access to our solutions and services remains free from unlawful intrusion. We publish data related to these requests, including
             the number of requests by country and how many requests we fulfill or reject, every six months in our Transparency Reports.On May 12, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive
             order mandating more transparency in the software supply chain.Cisco stood ready to respond to this order and supports the tech industry’s adoption of software bills of materials (SBOMs). Later
             in the year, after a vulnerability was discovered in the Apache Log4j 2 open-source software, Cisco Senior Vice President and Chief Security and Trust Officer Brad Arkin spoke to a
             U.S. Senate committee on Cisco’s response, the security risks inherent in all software, including open-source software, and steps the federal government and Congress can take to foster
             widespread adoption of secure software development practices.

              <h2>Economic Empowerment</h2>
              <div class="Economic-Empowerment-content">
              A sustainable and regenerative economy is one in which people have the knowledge, skills, and opportunities they need to support themselves and their families. Cisco works
              to facilitate widespread and equitable access to these resources. We do this by providing cash grants, donating Cisco technology, and contributing staff time and expertise to
              nonprofits that design, deliver, and scale technology-based solutions. Our investments drive economic empowerment for individuals and families in three ways:
              <ul>
                <li>Skills to careers: Delivering culturally relevant technical
                    and professional skills training and mentoring to help
                    people obtain meaningful jobs that support long-term career development.
                </li>
                <li>Financial inclusion: Offering affordable and relevant
                    financial products and services that enable people to
                    securely save and access their money, buy inputs for their crops, and pay school fees.
                </li>
                <li>y Entrepreneurship: Helping entrepreneurs build networks,
                      connect with mentors, and gain access to investors and capital to launch and grow their businesses.
                </li>
              </ul>
              Beyond grants to nonprofits, awards programs are an importantpart of our strategy. Through prize competitions, we enable social entrepreneurs and changemakers to share their ideas
              on a global stage and, through our funding, advance their ideas to deliver results.

              <h3>Our impact</h3>
              <div class="Our-Impact-content">
              <b>Jumpstarting entrepreneurs’ biggest ideas</b>
                The Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge continues to inspire entrepreneurs to pitch their solutions to some of the world’s toughest problems. In 2022, US$1 million was awarded
                to 15 teams in 10 countries. A team from Kenya, Drop Access,won the Grand Prize worth US$250,000. Their solution, VacciBox,is a portable, low-cost solar-powered fridge that can be used
                to store vaccines even without a reliable cold chain. At a rural health care center in Kenya, the use of VacciBox has more than tripled vaccination rates.
                In response to the growing urgency to mitigate climate change,we introduced a new Climate Impact and Regeneration Prize category worth US$300,000. These prizes were awarded to
                teams with solutions to reduce or remove GHG emissions or regenerate depleted ecosystems. Across all prize categories,we received nearly 1200 applications in 2022. Setting a new
                record, 67 percent of winning teams have a woman founder.
